# 👋 Hey, I'm Franko Kirinčić!

    public string[] CurrentFocus => new[] 
    { 
        "Transforming product ideas into tangible solutions",
        "Building scalable SaaS platforms", 
        "Working in a small team of great individuals",
        "Using every opportunity to learn something new"
    };
    
    public bool IsAvailableForFreelance => true;
